#Bike Sales Data Dashboard
This project involved the creation of an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze a raw dataset of bike sales. The dashboard was designed to provide an intuitive and comprehensive view of sales performance, trends, and key metrics.

Key features of the dashboard include:

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Raw data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure accuracy.

Data Visualization: Utilized Excel's pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting to visualize key metrics such as total sales, sales by region, top-selling bikes, and sales trends over time.
